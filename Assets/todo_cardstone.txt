Classic Hearthstone remake
Vanilla + Naxx + GvG + BRM

First demo goal:
Vanilla Zoo mirror.
players in que counter in menu

 ./ts3server  daemon=1 pid_file=ts3server.pid
 
only way to run server in background? ctrl+z and & stops the server for some reason
	screen -L -d -m -s "card server" ./cardserver.x86_64

todo: 
rare bug when sequencing a ton of stuff at once in <5 frames? not sure if its a disconnect from pausing in editor. Impossible to replicate by humans.
auras in hover tooltip
replace all fade effects with some shader (FAR FUTURE TODO)
get a new color pallette this shit sucks ( future todo )
a bit of rotation on creeature anim facing the direction of attack?
different tooltip shape for hero power hover
creature floating should hit scale vector3.one?


--board.phaseOngoing bool or something to disable input until server sends "sequence over" message?


castinfo.redirect(minion/player) function

- weapon class colors?

triggers should return true/false to know whether or not to confirm anim 
	(priestess anim only when theres other minions, hobgoblin anim only when its 1-cost, etc)
	-this might involve changing it so confirmtrigger is called within each triggereffects function? boring solution

batch removecreature visual animation for Vanish when adding that

	
-move triggereffects and auraeffects into trigger and aura class?

- change after attack events if target is changed to/from face/minion

refactor hasaura(taunt / stealth)

change button gfx to not be fishlike

Mechanics for next demo:
= Secret removal without trigger (Flare)
= Overload
= Discover (server initiated choose from 3, no input until choice is made)


- Serverside target eligibilty check (anti lag/cheating)

- rope (chess timer?)

===============================================
=====================DONE======================
================================================ 
- simple play history, updated in visual que? confirm play/trigger/battlecry would have to include targets in message
	- attacks in playhistory
	
-alert when match found

nerubian froze  blizz after deathrattle. bug.

= Choose one cards + Druid deck: 
	-disable all inputs/highlights while choosing
	-Transform Minion messages

- simple leaderboard (w-l (+winrate) with each class, and vs each class, and total)	

- deck counter fatigue counter

- deck counter color change

choice pos on minions (goes off screen if too far on edge)
animqueue for transformation

- stop the insta-targeting on choose cards (dragtargeting = false)
- set board eligible targets according to the new choice spell, not the original card

- freeze and immune auras appear out of order. but only on receiving side HERO.. need auraconfirm anim que..

-fatigue anim


- EDWIN + TEACHER HIT FACE, SECRET ANIM - EDWIN HIT DIDNT GO OFF, TOO FAST? or hitbox too small?

- playing minion during a secret attack pause causes overlap position

-error when attacking with doomguard too fast while secret anim is going (while its still preplay?)
confirm preattack and attack messages cant find creature obj in dictionary

- own iceblock pops if enemy firbealls self?

-milled cards sp formatting
- Vancleef/shiv/step

- CARD IN HAND COUNTER
deathrattle/spawned source minions should pop out lerpzoom, not drop in

FIX REPEAT CODE IN ANIMATOINMANAGER.CARDS?

- DECK EDITOR

- turn indicator (end turn button color)
= EFFECT FOR SPELL POWER aura 

- screenshake on big hits (8+)

-CLASS COLOR CARDS
-Show tribe on card
-animations on all cards
addcreature order visual issue
	= happens when minions are dying and being summoned simultaneously (imp boss, patron)
	
-dynamic mana cost cards (giants) - use special auras that are added from database?
	= holding card highlighting in hand (clientside aura check)

= southsea and warsong [charge giving], rework charge initaura (bool summoning sickness?)

= Freeze (Minions and players)

Secrets
	=server secretplayed card "names"(mage secret, hunter secret, etc..);
	=server addsecret, triggersecret, removesecret messages.
	=board "Secret Triggered!" animation.

-confirm trigger anim for weapons

= clean up healing/heal triggers

= Spell power
	-Spell power aura effect
	-Spell power card text update
	
= addcard message to client for stuff like sap, shadowstep, antonidas
	remove minion with no deathrattle function


ordercards fix with adding/discarding at the same time. delay on remove and add

discard cost change bug?

= Combo

= Stealth

= Player Armor

-i dont like the 1 frame anim delay.. maybe this isnt needed if theres an animation before destroy messages? maybe we can make destroy messages start a new coroutine queue?

= "Weapon target" spells like Deadly poison and Blade Flurry (can't be played without weapon)
	
bug: destroying multiple minions together anim isnt smooth

= Weapons & Player Attack
	- class Weapon? have one in Player class and one in Hero? //done
	- Swing messages and confirmations	 //done
	- Weapon battlecry, deathrattle/triggers (truesilver, hunter eaglehorn bow) //done
	- animations for all the wep/hero damage stuff //done
	- weapon sheathe visuals //done
	- weapon equip animation //done
	- weapon hover tooltip //done

messageReceivedOrder should be an int. ushort is too small

= Mana cost changing auras.
	- permanent auras on cards (Thaurissan) //DONE
	
	- temporary auras on player (Loatheb, Millhouse) //done
	
	- temporary aura for single casts (Prep) - Same as above? //done
		-Implemented using Triggers on player?
		
	- minion attached auras (Apprentice, Mana wraith) //done
	
	- communicate manacost in discarded/played cards from opponent //DONE
	
	-temporary trigger for loatheb start of turn trigger? idk
	
	-aura.source should be another aura instead of minion so you can stack loathebs? //done
	
need cost/stat "setting" effects like followtherules and millhouse, and crazed alchemist.

BUG: shield and other auras are not updating visually //removeaura mismatch msg, fixed
elevate card on enemy attacks

fix creatures swapping position too early before the one before it dies.
 This issue happens when ordercreatures is called when minion indexes changed too much in the backend - when lots deaths and other animations queued up.	

canattack property for 0attack and noattackaura

fix that issue where one time the mulligan cards froze mid air during mulligan end anim. //It was mull visualanim being too short

disconnect handling (end game immediately?)

menu with playerid setting name/textbox 

get a new font (maybe just numbers?) this shit sucks

no bounce in place

concede button

skulls on characters when attack is going to kill
	add bounce to this.
enemy mulligan anim (just move up down)

add visuals for silence?
fix prev battlecry dropping

start and end turn confirms to opponent players? //probably not needed


note: minion and spell cards look different.
gameover screen -> reset scene button?

damage projectiles for flame imp and soulfire

card art for each card
creature class color

summoning ally minions should happen client side first? (future todo)

change animinfo to contain minions and creatures/cards whatever instead of indexes - it breaks if index changes between anims!

maybe have board client execute everything instantly but only show it by waiting for animations queue <-- probably the best solution but a lot of work
case: when imp gang boss has a lot of anims queued but theyre not spawned, playig something on right of the boss will make it spawn on the farthest edge after imps
so playing a minion on rightmost side should always register as index -1 or whatever
	--go through each message and split it into backend and visuals (even updateminion/hero)
try dictionary approach for preshow: <pos, minion> prevminions.

health text color on hero hp
hovertooltip for hero power
HIGHLIGHT AVAILABLE TARGETS (ugly?)
new gfx for the targeting arrow

hover tooltips + enemy play popup

"-X" damage splash
HIGHLIGHT AVAILABLE ATTACKERS/CARDS

make new sorting layers for cards and creatures (includes heroes). and UI elements

deathrattle anim
mill anim	

minion attack anim

change hero frame. no circles in this game.

change camera angle to be further to the side?
hidecard() and showcard() fade/scale
minion play anim. card goes to minion pos and fades/disappears, then minion spawns?
card anims for letting go of play + mulligan + discard

todo: hand limit + discarding + milling.

message order system
if reached max bits for ushort, maybe add some sort of "cycle counter" in player class that rolls over every "prestige"
TODO: if message fails (index out of range etc..) discard all following messages in que?.

todo: aura communication.

todo: hero power TARGETING and other hero powers (ping).

todo: valid target exist check for abusive/shattered sun so you can play them with no targets, etc...
